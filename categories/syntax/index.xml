Previously, I was a Research Scientist and Team Lead at Intel Labs, where I delved into topics at the intersection of Deep Learning and NLP. I hold both an MSc and a BSc from the Technion.
I am deeply interested in the practical applications of large language models, particularly in terms of efficiency, hardware optimization, and their generative capabilities.</description></item></channel></rss>
