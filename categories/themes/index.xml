I completed my MSc and BSc at the Technion.
I am highly interested and involved in working with large language models. In particular, efficiency aspects of all kinds of NLP models, hardware optimization aspects, extractive and generative Question Answering systems, few-shot capabilities of large language models and Information Retrieval systems.</description></item></channel></rss>
